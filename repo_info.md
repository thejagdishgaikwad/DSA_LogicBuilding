# DSA_LogicBuilding
There exists some of the major Programs (C language) that'll probably help you for understanding the logical concept of DSA using C!
There Are Multiple Programs Regarding Basic/Adv Data Structures Following A Sequential Order :
List of Programs :
1. Array & Multi-Dimensional Array :

1A. Write a program to store the elements in 1-D array and perform the operations like
searching, sorting and reversing the elements. [Menu Driven]

1B. Read the two arrays from the user and merge them and display the elements in
sorted order. [Menu Driven]

1C. Write a program to perform the Matrix addition, Multiplication and Transpose
Operation. [Menu Driven]

2. Adv Tree Structres :

2A. Write a program to insert the element into maximum heap.
2B. Write a program to insert the element into minimum heap.

3. Sorting Techniques :

3A. Write a program to implement bubble sort.
3B. Write a program to implement selection sort.
3C. Write a program to implement insertion sort.

4. Sorting & Searching Techniques :

4A. Write a program to implement merge sort.
4B. Write a program to search the element using sequential search.
4C. Write a program to search the element using binary search.

5. Collision Techniques :

5A. Write a program to implement the collision technique.
5B. Write a program to implement the concept of linear probing.
